Campus Navigation App for IIT Hyderabad

This is a campus navigation web app built by "AKSHAT BANZAL and ATUL BOYAL" for IITH (IIT Hyderabad).

‚Ä¢ Search for routes between any two locations on the IITH campus
‚Ä¢ See the path and step-by-step directions on an interactive map
‚Ä¢ Only shows the locations you actually care about (no clutter)
‚Ä¢ Super fast‚Äîno need to refresh the page for new routes
